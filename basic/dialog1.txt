1 Hi, I am looking for a 4 star guesthouse.    I have 18 results. What price range would you like?
2 Money is no object, but I'd like it to be a 4 star location please. And I'd only like to stay on the north side of town.    I have about 8 different options. Most are moderately priced. There is one that is cheap. Do you have a preference as to which?
3 I need a place that has enough beds for 7 persons for 3 nights starting this Thursday.    I'm afraid that wont work. Can we try a different day or shorter length of stay?
4 Yeah, how about for one day? Please get me the reference number if that works    Which hotel would you like of the available choices?
5 Whatever is available. But I would prefer a guesthouse with free parking.    Arbury Lodge guesthouse is able to accommodate your party of 7 for Thursday night. Your reference number is 7PLMHREX. Is there anything else you need?
6 No, that about covers everything. Thanks for your help.    Excellent. Take care!

1 I want to find an expensive 4 star hotel.    I have 2 expensive 4 star hotels, one in the west and one in the centre of town. Do you have a preference to area?
2 Do you have one in the south that includes free parking?    I'm sorry, no, none in the south.
3 Okay, I'd really like to stay on the south end of town so is there one in the cheap price range instead?    i don't have any hotels in the south part of town.
4 Well are there any cheap hotels anywhere in town?    There is a cheap hotel with 4 stars on the west side of town. If you could restate your exact preferences I can try searching again.
5 Sure.  Look for a cheap hotel, 4 stars, in the south.  Free parking also.    There are no hotels that meet your criteria in the south.  There is one cheap 4 star guesthouse with parking in the south. Does that work?
6 Can we start over? I think there is a bit of confusion. I need a hotel with four stars, in the south, and free parking    There is nothing in the expensive range, there is a choice of one cheap or one moderate 4 star guesthouse in the south with parking. Would either of these be OK?
7 Cheap is fine. Please book for Friday, 3 nights, 3 people.    It is not open then, how about a shorter stay?
8 I can book for 1 night instead.    Very good.  You are set for 1 night at Rosa's.  The reference number is 8QUJMPP7.  Is there anything else I can help with?
9 No, that's it for now.  Thank you.    You're welcome. Enjoy your day.
